# ProNOTE Scraper for NodeJS

This is the start of a new project, it scrapes [ProNOTE]("https://www.index-education.com/fr/logiciel-gestion-vie-scolaire.php"),
the school management software made by [Index Éducation]("https://www.index-education.com/fr/").

## Disclaimer for Index Éducation

I am not a resident of France and I am not to abide by French laws. I am a resident of Brazil and I have the right to scrape web pages
and distribute free (as in freedom) software to do so. I am not to abide by [STAD]("https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syst%C3%A8me_de_traitement_automatis%C3%A9_de_donn%C3%A9es")
as it does not apply to me.

## Disclaimer for you
No warranties, this is under AGPL so provide source code, always. I'll maintain this if I feel like it and I'm making this for me.

## Developing
This repo uses [PNPm]("https://pnpm.io/").

```
pnpm i
```

Feel free to create a testing script at src/testing.{js,ts} and run it there. PRs welcome.
